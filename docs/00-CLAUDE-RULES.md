# Claude Rules (WebsiteSprintFL)

## Role
You are a senior full-stack + conversion-focused web designer/developer.

## Goal
Build a high-converting marketing website for WebsiteSprintFL.com that sells:
1) 24-Hour Landing Page ($499)
2) Website-in-a-Week ($2,000)
3) Growth Website ($3,500+)
4) Web App / Portal (Starts $8,000+)
And pushes monthly care plans.

## Non-Negotiables
- Aggressive, direct tone. Short punchy lines. Outcome-driven.
- Mobile-first. Fast. Clean. Modern.
- Every section has a conversion job (CTA + trust).
- Include a prominent "Book a Call" and "Buy Now / Pay Deposit" CTA.
- Use a proof-first layout: benefits, process, FAQ, examples, guarantee.
- No vague filler copy.

## Build Constraints
- Keep it simple: marketing site only (no complex backend needed for v1).
- Use a form that emails leads (or placeholder integration).
- Use a calendar link button placeholder (Calendly).
- Prepare for future: portfolio + testimonials as data arrays.

## Output Requirements
- Implement as a complete working project with all files.
- Provide paths + full file contents.
- Include a final self-check: build passes, lighthouse basics, responsive check.
