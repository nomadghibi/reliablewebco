# Sales System

## Qualification (fast)
- What service do you sell?
- What city/service area?
- What’s your main offer?
- Do you want calls, bookings, or form leads?
- Do you need it live in 24 hours or 7 days?

## Objection handling
“$499 seems high”:
- This is a conversion build + tracking + deployment in 24 hours (not a template dump).
- Cheaper options exist, but you’ll lose speed/quality.

“I want a full website for $499”:
- The $499 package is a single conversion page.
- Full site is Website-in-a-Week for $2,000.

## DM Script (primary)
“Hey — I build and launch a lead-focused landing page in 24 hours for $499. It’s designed to generate calls and form leads (not just look good). Want me to send a demo style?”

## AI Audit Offer (lead generation)
- Free mini audit: 3-5 findings, 24-hour turnaround.
- Full audit: scored report + priority action plan.

Audit pitch:
- "If you share your current website, I will run a full AI + expert audit and send a clear report with P0/P1/P2 fixes."
- "You will see exactly what is hurting leads and local SEO, plus what to fix first."

Audit close:
- "If you want, we can implement the top fixes this week and track form/call conversion lifts."
