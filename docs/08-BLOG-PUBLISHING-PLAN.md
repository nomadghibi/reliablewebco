# Blog Publishing Plan (SEO Clustered)

## Goal
Publish in a way that grows topical authority without keyword cannibalization, and routes article traffic into money pages (`/pricing`, `/contact`, `/locations/*`).

## Cluster Map

- URLs:

## Internal Linking Rules
- Every Cluster A (pricing) post must link to:
  - `/pricing`
  - `/contact`
- Every Cluster B (lead-gen) post must link to:
  - `/contact`
  - one of `/locations/palm-bay-fl`, `/locations/melbourne-fl`, `/locations/orlando-fl`
- Every Cluster C (local SEO) post must link to:
  - `/locations`
  - at least two city pages
  - `/pricing`
- Every Cluster D/E/F post must link to:
  - one relevant pillar post
  - `/contact`

## No-Cannibalization Rules
- One primary keyword intent per post, one secondary keyword family.
- Do not reuse identical H1 patterns across same cluster.
- Keep exact-match keyword in:
  - slug
  - title
  - first 120 words
  - one H2
- For city posts, assign one city-primary per URL; cross-link cities, do not duplicate city-intent copy.
- Use canonical self-reference on every blog post (already implemented).

## On-Page SEO Minimum (every post)
- Title: 50-65 chars, keyword front-loaded.
- Meta description: 140-160 chars with local/business outcome intent.
- At least 1 contextual link to `/pricing` or `/contact`.
- FAQ section present (already in blog model).
- Word count target: 1500-2000 (auto-expanded by long-form module system).

## Monthly Operating Cadence
- Week 1: publish 2 money-intent posts (Cluster A/B).
- Week 2: publish 1 local SEO + 1 trust post (Cluster C/E).
- Week 3: publish 1 niche post (Cluster D) + refresh older top performer.
- Week 4: review Search Console query overlap and adjust internal anchors.
