# Homepage Copy (Aggressive)

## HERO
Headline:
Florida businesses — if your website isn’t getting calls, it’s broken.

Subhead:
I build landing pages in 24 hours and full websites in a week.
Fast launch. Clean design. Built to convert.

Primary CTA: Book a Call
Secondary CTA: Get a 24-Hour Landing Page ($499)

Micro-trust:
No agency bloat. No endless meetings. Just results.

## SUCCESS / OUTCOME STRIP
What you get:
- More calls
- More form leads
- Clear message
- Fast load speed
- Mobile-first

---

## PROBLEM / AGITATE
Most small business websites fail for 3 reasons:
1) They load slow
2) They confuse people
3) They don’t push one clear action

That’s why you’re “online”… but still not winning jobs.
